Have a look at their projects! They're much more ambitious than mine: I am trying to address a dead simple use case.

My younger brother works nights as a *REDACTED*, and only has an iphone. 
We want to include him in our games, but so far he's been limited to voice chat and the occasional look at a stream of one of our ongoing streams.

In a screenshot for the original `simplemobile` there is a "canvas & chat" only view 
That is my goal. Let a phone user see a broad view of the canvas (maybe) and FOR SURE be able to access the chat window, and tap on the [`Dice Tray`]() module

Goal:
 - support ios-safari
 - support v12
 - support dice tray
 - let my bro roll dice: a great way of enabling him to engage with the game.
